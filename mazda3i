	- replace spark plugs (x4)
	- replace air filter
	- go to discount tire and replace tires with 
michelin defenders
	- clean up headlights and taillights
	- look at oil filter and oil levels and inspect the leakage. I think I'll invest in a mazda oil filter for now on because this is the second time leakage has occurred.

brake fluid should have been replaced a couple years ago whenever I took it to tommys hitech to look at my braking system. 

I want to improve the response time of acceleration. there was a way to do this by changig a connection somewhere. I'll find any info on this later.

- changed all tires to michelin defender 2s; cost about $874.

- inspected the oil leak. tightened the drain plug and filter. it might not be an oil leak. might be a hose that is leaking. oil levels are full, it seems.
